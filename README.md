# An Energy-aware Skill Score for Earth science climate models

The motivation and mathematics behind the energy-aware skill score are covered in the [Introduction](intro.md).

Also stored here is a Python script ([calc-skill-score.py](calc-skill-score.py)) that is currently under development.
This Python code is intended to calculate skill scores from data archives held on the [JASMIN server](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/docs/long-term-archive-storage/ceda-archive/).

Lastly, there is [setup-pyenv.sh](setup-pyenv.sh), a script for installing a Python environment that will allow you to run the Python code mentioned above.
